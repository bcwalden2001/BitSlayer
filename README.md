## Pre-requisities:

Download the latest version of LÃ–VE from the Love2D [website](https://love2d.org/#download), and install it.

## Two ways to run the game:

1) Drag the game folder onto love.exe inside of the LOVE folder (this will be in the "Program Files" folder on Windows or wherever you installed love) 

2) From the command line:
   
   a) Using full path, where the first path is the path of love.exe and the second path is the path of the game folder:

         ** & "C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\BitSlayer" **

   b) Using a simple shortcut:

         love .

   _This only works when the path of LOVE is added to your system's PATH environment variable_
   
      To do this on Windows:
   
      1) Press the Windows Key
      2) open "Edit the system environment variables" in the control panel
      3) click Environment Variables...
      4) click on Path under System variables
      5) click Edit
      6) click New 
      7) add the path of the LOVE folder
      8) click OK on all the windows (if you don't do this the changes made won't be saved)

         **Now the shortcut above should work.**
