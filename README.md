## Pre-requisities:

Download the latest version of LÃ–VE from the [love2d website](https://love2d.org/#download), and install it.

## Two ways to run the game:

1) Drag the game folder onto love.exe inside of the LOVE folder (this will be in the "Program Files" folder on Windows) 

2) From the command line:
   
   a) Using full paths:

      **& "C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\BitSlayer" **

      - the first path is the path of love.exe and the second path is the path of the game folder

   b) Using a simple shortcut:

      **love .**
   
      _Note: This only works when the path of LOVE is added to your system's PATH environment variable_
   
      To do this on Windows:

      -> Press the Windows Key
      -> open "Edit the system environment variables" in the control panel
      -> click Environment Variables...
      -> click on Path under System variables
      -> click Edit
      -> click New
      -> add the path of the LOVE folder
      -> click Ok on all the windows (if you don't do this the changes made won't be saved)

      Now the shortcut above should work.
